"""
Python provides a number of ways to perform printing. Research
how to print using the printf operator, the `format` string 
method, and by using f-strings.
"""

x = 10
y = 2.24552
z = "I like turtles!"

# Using the printf operator (%), print the following feeding in the values of x,
# y, and z:
# x is 10, y is 2.25, z is "I like turtles!"

# print("a=%d, y=%d, z=%d" % (f(x,n),g(x,n)));

# Use the 'format' string method to print the same thing

# Finally, print the same thing using an f-string
print(f"X is {x}, y is {y} and z is the string {z}.");
